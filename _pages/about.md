**Hello!** I am the **co-founder and CEO** of [1SHANAI](https://1shans.com), where I lead the development and deployment of several AI applications. Our flagship project, [1shanAI](https://1shanai), focuses on an **AI for cloth** initiative that blends generative AI with the fashion industry. We are also developing ai to titok style sotries, and improving the aesthetics of the generative models.

**Research at MSU**  
In addition to running my startup, I am currently a **junior at Michigan State University**, conducting research under [Dr. Feng Liu](https://liufeng2915.github.io) and [Prof. Xiaoming Liu](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~liuxm/index2.html) in the MSU CVLab. My work primarily explores **Aesthetics and Emotions in Generative Models**, including 3D generation, image generation, and video generation and LLMs. Previously, I served as a **summer research intern** in the ENSURE program at MSU CVLab, where I improved the **controllability of diffusion models** for scene-level text-to-3D generation, and build datasets for the Cloth reconstruction. For more details, feel free to check my [publications](https://zianggu1.github.io/publications/).


**News**  
- **1shanAI** received the **“Best Use of Generative AI”** award at the MSU Hackathon (1/105)!

**Opportunities**  
If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations, please reach out to me at **guziang@msu.edu**.
