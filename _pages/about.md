**Hello!** I am the **co-founder and CEO** of [1ShanAI](https://1shans.com), where I lead the development and deployment of several AI applications. Our flagship project, [1Shan](https://1shanai), focuses on an **AI for cloth** initiative that blends generative AI with the fashion industry. We are also developing [Mythoverse](https://mythoverse.ai), a platform for creating and sharing stories as **audiobook-like TikTok-style videos**, and working on improving the **aesthetics** of generative models. **For more details, please visit our [website](https://1shanai.com).**

## Research at MSU
In addition to running my startup, I am currently a **junior at Michigan State University**, conducting research under [Dr. Feng Liu](https://liufeng2915.github.io) and [Prof. Xiaoming Liu](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~liuxm/index2.html) in the MSU CVLab. My work primarily explores **Aesthetics and Emotions in Generative Models**, including **3D generation**, **image generation**, **video generation**, and **LLMs**. 

Previously, I served as a **summer research intern** in the ENSURE program at MSU CVLab, where I improved the **controllability of diffusion models** for scene-level text-to-3D generation and built datasets for cloth reconstruction. For more details, feel free to check my [publications](https://zianggu1.github.io/publications/).
