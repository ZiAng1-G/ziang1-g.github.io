**Hello!** I am the **co-founder and CEO** of [1shan Technology](https://1shans.com), where I lead the development and deployment of several working applications. Our flagship project, [1shanAI](https://1shanai), focuses on an **AI for cloth** initiative that blends generative AI with the fashion industry.

**Research at MSU**  
In addition to running my startup, I am currently a **junior at Michigan State University**, conducting research under [Dr. Feng Liu](https://liufeng2915.github.io) and [Prof. Xiaoming Liu](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~liuxm/index2.html) in the MSU CVLab. My work primarily explores **3D object/scene understanding**, including 3D generation, 3D body reconstruction, and 3D recognition. I’m also interested in integrating **human emotions and aesthetics** into generative models. Previously, I served as a **summer research intern** in the ENSURE program at MSU CVLab, where I improved the **controllability of large diffusion models** for scene-level text-to-3D generation. For more details, feel free to check my [publications](https://zianggu1.github.io/publications/).

**News**  
- **1shanAI** received the **“Best Use of Generative AI”** award at the MSU Hackathon!

**Opportunities**  
I am **not** seeking a summer internship at this time. However, if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations, please reach out to me at **guziang@msu.edu**.
